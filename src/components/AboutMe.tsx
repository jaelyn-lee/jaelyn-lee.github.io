          After completing a web development course, I have been working on my
          personal projects and acquiring new tech skills. I am goal-oriented,
          naturally curious, and continuously striving to improve my skills. I
          challenge myself to demonstrate my grit. I am excited to continue
          growing in my career as a software developer and to take on new
          challenges along the way.
