          After completing a web development course, I have been working on my
          personal projects and acquiring new tech skills. I am goal-oriented,
          naturally curious, and continuously striving to improve my skills. I
          challenge myself to demonstrate my grit. I am excited to continue
          growing in my career as a software developer and to take on new
          challenges along the way.

        <p className="text-justify md:text-xl text-sm mt-2 font-light">
          In my free time, I enjoy staying active and exploring new fitness
          challenges, such as trying out new yoga poses or walking on different
          trails. I also love to read and learn, whether it's about a new
          technology or a different culture. I am excited to continue growing in
          my career as a software developer and to take on new challenges along
          the way.{' '}
