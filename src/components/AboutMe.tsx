          I started coding as a hobby and quickly realised my passion for it,
          and spent any free moment studying on my own. Eventually, I
          transferred my career to software development by studying at Dev
          Academy and now I am here as a developer. I am goal-oriented,
          naturally curious, and continuously striving to improve my skills. I
          challenge myself to demonstrate my grit and consistency. I am excited to continue
          growing in my career as a software developer and to take on new
          challenges along the way.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify md:text-xl text-sm mt-2 font-light">
          In my free time, I enjoy staying active and exploring new fitness
          challenges, such as trying out new yoga poses or walking on different
          trails. I also love to read and learn, whether it's about a new
          technology or a different culture. I am excited to continue growing in
          my career as a software developer and to take on new challenges along
          the way.{' '}
